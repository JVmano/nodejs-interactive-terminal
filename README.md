# NodeJS Interactive Terminal
This is a boilerplate for simple interactive terminal for nodeJS

## How?
This little project works mainly with [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) by doing the questions and saving the response.
The other dependencies are just for view like using ascii fonts with [figlet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/figlet) and more colored console logs with [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk).

## Why?
It's a anotation to myself for small projects and ideas that can use terminal system in JS or TS.

Eg. [Opensea Collection Refresher](https://github.com/JVmano/opensea-metadata-refresher) made by myself for pure utiliy :wink:

## How to use
1. Clone the repository
2. Use ``yarn install`` or ``npm install`` to install the dependencies
3. To start the project simply use ``yarn start`` or ``npm run start``

## Disclaimer
Most logic in this repo was based on a article about the possibility to create a interactive terminal. See the original post [here](https://opensource.com/article/18/7/node-js-interactive-cli).
